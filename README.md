# 🚗 FleetPulse — Multi-Location Fleet Intelligence Platform

**GeoTab Hackathon 2026 Entry** | Budget Rent a Car Las Vegas Demo

FleetPulse is an intelligent fleet management dashboard for multi-location rental operations. It connects to GeoTab's telematics API to provide real-time vehicle tracking, safety scoring, gamification, and **autonomous anomaly detection** across 8 Budget Rent a Car locations in Las Vegas.

![FleetPulse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Live-green) ![GeoTab](https://img.shields.io/badge/GeoTab-Integrated-blue) ![Vehicles](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vehicles-50-orange)

> **📝 Demo Mode Note:** The safety scoring system currently uses **mock data** for realistic visualization in the demo. The Geotab demo database (`demo_fleetpulse`) has no ExceptionEvents configured, resulting in all vehicles having perfect 100% scores when using real API data. Mock data provides realistic score distributions (70-100 range) with varied violation counts that match the Alert Distribution chart. **Production mode** is preserved in comments within `backend/services/safety_service.py` and can be re-enabled by uncommenting the real API calls.

An autonomous intelligence layer that continuously analyzes fleet telemetry:
- **Speed Anomaly Detection** — Flags vehicles exceeding speed thresholds with severity levels
- **Excessive Idle Detection** — Identifies vehicles idle for extended periods
- **Off-Route Alerts** — Detects vehicles leaving the Las Vegas metro area
- **After-Hours Monitoring** — Flags activity during 11 PM – 5 AM
- **Fleet Pattern Analysis** — Identifies unusual fleet-wide activity patterns
- **Location Inventory Balancing** — Alerts when locations have zero or excess vehicles
- Runs every 60 seconds with full alert history and pattern tracking

- 30-second vehicle refresh, 15-second alert refresh

### 📍 8 Budget Rent a Car Locations
W Sahara · Golden Nugget · Center Strip · Tropicana · LAS Airport · Gibson · Henderson Executive · Losee

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- GeoTab credentials (set in `~/.openclaw/.env.geotab` or project `.env`)
- **Optional**: Anthropic API key for Claude AI integration

### Environment Variables

#### Basic Setup (`.env` file in backend/)
```env
GEOTAB_DATABASE=demo_fleetpulse
GEOTAB_USERNAME=your_username
GEOTAB_PASSWORD=your_password
GEOTAB_SERVER=my.geotab.com
```

#### AI-Enhanced Setup (Optional - choose one)
```env
# Option 1: OpenRouter (connects Claude Max/Pro subscriptions)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://k1-fleetpulse.azurewebsites.net
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=FleetPulse

# Option 2: Anthropic Direct API (pay-per-use)  
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

For production, store API keys in Azure Key Vault/App Settings. Do not commit
provider keys into `.env` files.

#### Live Fleet Data Scope
```env
# Count active Geotab power units, not inactive historical devices or trailers.
FLEETPULSE_DEVICE_GROUP_IDS=GroupVehicleId
FLEETPULSE_EXCLUDED_DEVICE_GROUP_IDS=GroupTrailerId
FLEETPULSE_REQUIRE_ACTIVE_LIFECYCLE=true
FLEETPULSE_STATUS_STALE_HOURS=24
FLEETPULSE_SAFETY_DEMO_MODE=false
FLEETPULSE_MONITOR_ENABLED=false
FLEETPULSE_GEOTAB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10
FLEETPULSE_GEOTAB_MAX_WORKERS=4
FLEETPULSE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=30
FLEETPULSE_CACHE_FALLBACK_SECONDS=300
```

The dashboard response includes source metadata such as `raw_device_count`,
`scoped_device_count`, and `stale_status_count` so operators can tell whether a
KPI is live and business-scoped. If Geotab times out, FleetPulse returns a
short-lived cached live response with `source_mode=cached_after_geotab_timeout`;
when no cache exists, it returns an explicit unavailable/empty response instead
of demo numbers.

#### XTRA Lease Geofence Feed
```env
FLEETPULSE_XTRA_INGESTION_ENABLED=true
FLEETPULSE_XTRA_OUTLOOK_MAILBOX=xtra-feed@example.com
FLEETPULSE_XTRA_GEOFENCE_FOLDER=XTRA Lease Tracking
FLEETPULSE_XTRA_INGESTION_API_KEY=store-in-key-vault
FLEETPULSE_GRAPH_TENANT_ID=tenant-id
FLEETPULSE_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID=app-client-id
FLEETPULSE_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=store-in-key-vault
FLEETPULSE_XTRA_STATE_PATH=/home/data/fleetpulse_xtra_lease_ingestion_state.json
FLEETPULSE_XTRA_SHAREPOINT_LOG_WEBHOOK_URL=
FLEETPULSE_TEAMS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=
FLEETPULSE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
FLEETPULSE_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
FLEETPULSE_TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=
FLEETPULSE_TWILIO_ALERT_TO_NUMBER=
```

The XTRA adapter reads one configured Outlook folder through Microsoft Graph,
stores only read-only geofence event references, and deduplicates each email by
idempotency key. Use a least-privilege app registration with mailbox-scoped
Graph access; grant only `Mail.Read` and constrain the service principal to the
configured XTRA mailbox with Exchange application RBAC or an application access
policy. Trigger ingestion from an approved scheduler with:

```bash
curl -X POST https://k1-fleetpulse.azurewebsites.net/api/control-tower/trailers/xtra/ingest \
  -H "X-FleetPulse-Xtra-Key: $FLEETPULSE_XTRA_INGESTION_API_KEY"
```

#### AtoB Fuel Expense Imports
```env
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_FUEL_STATE_PATH=/home/data/fleetpulse_atob_fuel_expenses.json
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_FUEL_RETAINED_RECORDS=10000
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_ENABLED=true
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL=https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/operations
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_NAME=Documents
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_FOLDER_PATH=atob
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_SOURCE_FILE_URLS=
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_INGESTION_API_KEY=store-in-key-vault
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_POWERBI_WORKSPACE_ID=b801f80d-5303-4121-abd1-1163639ef58b
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_POWERBI_FOLDER_ID=5b6ccf55-37ff-436e-8e19-6d1152334928
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_POWERBI_UI_SUBFOLDER_ID=52730
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_POWERBI_REPORT_ID=42dd5456-e377-4fb2-bb77-d28ef3a4c25a
FLEETPULSE_ATOB_POWERBI_SEMANTIC_MODEL_ID=8212573f-83a8-418d-b144-73b65b503230
```

The Fuel tab can import downloaded AtoB CSV, TSV, JSON, or JSONL fuel reports
directly, or sync the BI-connected SharePoint folder used for fuel reporting.
FleetPulse stores those rows as read-only expense references, deduplicates them
with idempotency keys, redacts full card numbers in retained raw rows, and uses
actual imported cost in fuel analytics when present. Geotab remains authoritative
for miles, utilization, and telemetry; AtoB rows are cost evidence only. The
SharePoint sync endpoint is `POST /api/fuel/atob/sharepoint/sync` and should be
called by a scheduler with `X-FleetPulse-AtoB-Key`.

The current K1 Operations Hub Power BI folder is `AtoB` in workspace
`b801f80d-5303-4121-abd1-1163639ef58b`; Fabric reports the folder ID as
`5b6ccf55-37ff-436e-8e19-6d1152334928`. The live `AtoB Fuel Transactions`
semantic model (`8212573f-83a8-418d-b144-73b65b503230`) is backed by an
uploaded SharePoint file today. Use `FLEETPULSE_ATOB_SHAREPOINT_SOURCE_FILE_URLS`
as the short-term bridge for that file-backed source, then repoint the semantic
model to the shared `atob` folder so FleetPulse, SharePoint, and Power BI read
from the same governed location.

#### Operating Cost Per Mile / Hour
```env
FLEETPULSE_LANE_STABILITY_ORDER_FEED_URL=
FLEETPULSE_LANE_STABILITY_ORDER_FEED_API_KEY=
FLEETPULSE_XCELERATOR_REVIEW_ORDERS_STATE_PATH=/home/data/fleetpulse_xcelerator_review_orders.json
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_FEED_URL=
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_STATE_PATH=/home/data/fleetpulse_qbo_expenses.json
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_FEED_PATH=
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_FEED_API_KEY=
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_FEED_API_KEY_HEADER=X-FleetPulse-QBO-Key
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_IMPORT_API_KEY=
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXPENSE_RETAINED_RECORDS=50000
FLEETPULSE_QBO_INSURANCE_ACCOUNT_PATTERNS=insurance
FLEETPULSE_QBO_EXCLUDED_ACCOUNT_PATTERNS=accounts receivable,atob,carrier,cogs,contractor,cost of goods sold,diesel,driver pay,driver settlement,factoring,freight in,fuel,income,payroll,revenue,sales,wages
FLEETPULSE_OPERATING_COST_GEOTAB_CONCURRENCY=4
FLEETPULSE_OPERATING_COST_GEOTAB_RETRIES=2
```

`GET /api/fuel/operating-cost?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` returns weekly
cost-per-mile and cost-per-hour rows. The calculation uses Geotab miles/hours,
AtoB fuel/DEF cost, Xcelerator driver pay, and QBO insurance/other expenses.
When a feed is missing, FleetPulse marks the source as unresolved and leaves
the true CPM/hour fields blank while still showing the known cost stack.
Geotab OData weeks are fetched concurrently and retried so transient Data
Connector read timeouts do not silently shrink the mileage/hour denominator.
Downloaded Xcelerator ReviewOrders CSV/JSON exports can be loaded with
`POST /api/fuel/xcelerator/review-orders/import`; FleetPulse stores them as
read-only driver-pay evidence and marks the source partial when the imported
date span does not cover the requested reporting window.
Downloaded QBO transaction-detail expense CSV/JSON exports can be loaded with
`POST /api/fuel/qbo/expenses/import`; FleetPulse stores insurance and other
operating expenses as read-only QBO evidence, excludes known fuel/driver-pay/COGS
accounts to prevent double counting, and uses import coverage dates when
provided to avoid certifying partial finance feeds as complete.

#### Live Trailer Tracking
```env
FLEETPULSE_TRAILER_GROUP_IDS=GroupTrailerId
FLEETPULSE_TRAILER_MATCH_RADIUS_METERS=150
FLEETPULSE_TRAILER_DRIVER_LOOKBACK_HOURS=12
```

`GET /api/control-tower/trailers/live` merges Geotab trailer GPS with the
latest XTRA geofence events as read-only references. Custody is proximity-based:
the nearest scoped Geotab tractor within `FLEETPULSE_TRAILER_MATCH_RADIUS_METERS`
is shown as a candidate tractor/driver, not as an authoritative dispatch
assignment. Xcelerator should remain the final dispatch/load owner when that
assignment feed is connected.

### Backend
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (includes anthropic SDK)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and edit environment variables
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your credentials

# Start the backend
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --port 8080
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — the Vite dev server proxies API calls to the backend on port 8080.

## 🧠 AI Integration

FleetPulse supports **three AI modes** for enhanced fleet intelligence:

### 1. OpenRouter (Recommended 🌟)
- **Use your Claude Max ($100/mo) or Pro ($20/mo) subscription** 
- Connect existing subscription via OpenRouter for free tier usage
- Same Claude model quality without additional per-use charges
- Free tier credits available even without subscription

**Setup:**
1. Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and create an account
2. Generate an API key in your dashboard
3. Optionally: Connect your Claude subscription for enhanced usage
4. Configure the key in FleetPulse settings

### 2. Anthropic Direct API
- **Pay-per-use** pricing (~$3 per million tokens)
- Direct access to Anthropic's API
- Most reliable option with full feature set
- Best for high-volume usage with predictable costs

**Setup:**
1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Add credit to your account for billing
3. Configure the key in FleetPulse settings

### 3. Demo Mode
- **No API key required** — works out of the box
- Uses intelligent pattern matching for common fleet queries
- Great for testing and basic fleet analysis
- Automatically activated when no API key is configured

**Features in both modes:**
- Natural language fleet queries
- Data visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Safety analysis and recommendations
- Maintenance predictions
- Cost optimization insights
- Real-time fleet status integration

**Example queries:**
- "Which location has the best safety scores?"
- "Show me vehicles with high idle time"
- "What are the cost-saving recommendations?"
- "How is our fuel efficiency trending?"
- "Any vehicles need maintenance soon?"

## 🤖 Claude Desktop Integration (MCP)

FleetPulse includes a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that allows Claude Desktop and other MCP clients to interact with fleet data conversationally.

### Features
- **Natural Language Queries**: "Which location has the best safety scores?" or "Show me vehicles with high idle time"
- **Rich Formatted Responses**: Markdown tables, insights, and contextual information
- **Real-time Data**: Direct access to live fleet information through the FastAPI backend
- **Fleet Summary Resource**: Claude can read current fleet status for context

### Available MCP Tools

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, mygeotab SDK, Pydantic v2
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet, Recharts
- **Telemetry:** GeoTab API (50 vehicles, real-time DeviceStatusInfo, Trips, ExceptionEvents)
- **Architecture:** REST API with background agentic monitoring thread

## 🔁 Zapier Integration

FleetPulse exposes a Zapier-safe integration surface under `/api/zapier`.
Zapier remains an orchestration layer only; FleetPulse does not accept writes
from Zapier and does not overwrite Geotab.

### Recommended Zaps

1. **Fleet snapshot report**
   - Trigger: Schedule by Zapier
   - Action: Webhooks by Zapier `GET`
   - URL: `https://k1-fleetpulse.azurewebsites.net/api/zapier/triggers/fleet-snapshot`
   - Follow-up: send Teams/email summary, write to Sheets, or store in Power BI helper table.

2. **Risk vehicle alert**
   - Trigger: Schedule by Zapier
   - Action: Webhooks by Zapier `GET`
   - URL: `https://k1-fleetpulse.azurewebsites.net/api/zapier/triggers/risk-vehicles?max_score=85&min_events=1`
   - Follow-up: send to Teams first for operator validation.

3. **Catch Hook push**
   - Configure a Zapier Catch Hook URL in `FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Set `FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_ENABLED=true`
   - Call `POST /api/zapier/actions/push-snapshot` from an approved scheduler or operator tool.
   - Add a guard step before Teams/email that calls
     `POST https://k1-fleetpulse.azurewebsites.net/api/zapier/actions/verify-snapshot`
     with the Catch Hook payload. Continue only when `valid=true`.
   - If Zapier cannot pass the full nested payload cleanly, use the compact guard:
     call `POST /api/zapier/actions/verify-message` with `teams_message` and
     `teams_message_signature`, then send only the verified `teams_message`.

### Zapier Environment Variables

```env
FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_ENABLED=false
FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=
FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_API_KEY=
FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_SHARED_SECRET=
FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15
```

Security notes:

- `FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_API_KEY` protects the push endpoint when configured.
- `FLEETPULSE_ZAPIER_SHARED_SECRET` signs outbound Catch Hook payloads with `payload_signature`
  and `X-FleetPulse-Signature`; it also signs a compact `teams_message`.
  Zapier can verify via FleetPulse without storing this secret.
- Polling trigger endpoints are read-only Geotab projections.

## 🔌 MyGeotab Add-In

FleetPulse includes a MyGeotab Add-In that runs **inside** the MyGeotab portal.

### Installation

1. In MyGeotab, go to **Administration → System Settings → Add-Ins**
2. Click **New Add-In** and paste the contents of `addin/config.json`
   - Or, if hosting the add-in files on a server, update the `url` fields to point to your hosted `addin/fleetpulse/` directory
3. Save and refresh MyGeotab — "FleetPulse" will appear in the navigation

### How It Works

- When loaded inside MyGeotab, the add-in receives the `api` and `state` objects from the SDK
- It calls the Geotab API directly (Get Device, Get Trip, Get ExceptionEvent) to render KPIs, vehicle lists, and safety data
- A "Full Dashboard" mode embeds the live FleetPulse web app in an iframe
- Works in standalone mode too (fetches from the FleetPulse API)

## 📊 Data Connector Integration

FleetPulse integrates with the **Geotab Data Connector** (OData v4) for pre-aggregated fleet analytics.

### Activation

The Data Connector must be activated on your database:

1. In MyGeotab → **Administration → System Settings → Add-Ins**
2. Add: `{"url": "https://app.geotab.com/addins/geotab/dataConnector/manifest.json"}`
3. Save and wait 2-3 hours for the data pipeline to backfill

### Access URL

FleetPulse starts with Geotab's unified OData URL and follows the redirect to
the current federation server:

`https://data-connector.geotab.com/odata/v4/svc/`

If MyGeotab shows a numbered Access URL in the Data Connector add-in, pin it
with `GEOTAB_ODATA_SERVER` so FleetPulse can skip discovery:

`GEOTAB_ODATA_SERVER=https://odata-connector-2.geotab.com/odata/v4/svc/`

To keep the Connector tab stable when Geotab OData is slow, cap live OData
fan-out and retry short read timeouts:

```env
FLEETPULSE_DATA_CONNECTOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=6
FLEETPULSE_DATA_CONNECTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=20
FLEETPULSE_DATA_CONNECTOR_RETRY_COUNT=1
FLEETPULSE_DATA_CONNECTOR_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
```

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/data-connector/status` | Sanitized auth/server readiness without exposing Geotab secrets |
| `GET /api/data-connector/tables` | List available OData tables |
| `GET /api/data-connector/vehicle-kpis?days=14` | Per-vehicle utilization: distance in miles, drive/idle hours, trips, fuel |
| `GET /api/data-connector/safety-scores?days=14` | Fleet and vehicle safety scores |
| `GET /api/data-connector/fault-trends?days=14` | Fault code frequency and trends |
| `GET /api/data-connector/trip-summary?days=14` | Trip aggregates per vehicle with distance in miles |

### Frontend

Navigate to the **Connector** tab in the FleetPulse dashboard to see:
- Fleet utilization KPIs (distance, drive hours, idle hours, utilization %)
- Per-vehicle utilization table
- Aggregated safety scores
- Fault code trends
